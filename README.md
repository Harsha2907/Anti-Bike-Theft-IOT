# 🚴 Anti-Bike-Theft IoT

An IoT project using **ESP8266 (NodeMCU)** and **Blynk** to prevent bike theft.  
The system detects ignition voltage, sends alerts to the Blynk app, and activates buzzer + LEDs for warning.

## 🔧 Components
- ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
- Voltage Sensor
- Buzzer + LEDs
- Blynk App

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open code in Arduino IDE and install ESP8266 + Blynk libraries.  
2. Update WiFi and Blynk credentials.  
3. Upload code to NodeMCU.  
4. Monitor bike status on the Blynk app.
